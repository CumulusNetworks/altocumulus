# Altocumulus

**IMPORTANT** This is a proof of concept, it might not even work for your deployment. I'm planning on refactoring this to use the Neutron agent framework as well as Neutron RPC.

Integrate your Cumulus Linux switch with OpenStack Neutron

Manages VLAN bridges on the switch and L2 connectivity between (compute) hosts and the VLAN bridges. Uses LLDP to perform auto-discovery of hosts and the switchports they are connected to.

Uses the same conventions as the Linux Bridge agent so that DHCP/L3 agents can theoretically be hosted on the switch.

## Usage

There are two components involved in this project:

* ML2 mechanism driver (runs on hosts with Neutron server)
* HTTP API server (runs on switches)

## Installation

### ML2 mechanism driver

1. Install the driver and its dependencies with the following

    ```bash
    pip install git+git://github.com/CumulusNetworks/altocumulus.git
    pip install requests
    ```

2. Add `cumulus` to the `mechanism_drivers` field in `/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`
3. Configure `/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_cumulus.ini`

### HTTP API server

1. Install the API server

    ```bash
    pip install git+git://github.com/CumulusNetworks/altocumulus.git
    ```

2. Place the included Upstart script in `/etc/init` and run `start altocumulus-api`

## To-do

* Authentication
* Pluggable discovery strategies
* Integration with `oslo.rootwrap` for unprivileged operation
* Working upstart script
